Created first ML pipeline: gathered and cleaned data, utilized logistic regression model first and achieved ~ 81% accuracy.

Updated: Added a random forest model to compare to the linear regression model. Initial hypothesis was the rf model may be more
         accuarte when compared to the logistic regression model. However, this was not the case, it was, in fact, slightly less
         accurate at ~ 79%. This may be due to data set size (being too low) or signals.
